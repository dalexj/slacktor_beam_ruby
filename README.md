## Slacktor Beam Ruby
You can join any time you like, but you can never leave.

[Original here](https://github.com/worace/slacktor-beam) is written and clojure, but who knows how to run that?

To run this:

* `bundle`
* `cp run.sh.example run.sh`
* get your [slack key](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens)
* set it inside `run.sh`
* `source run.sh`
